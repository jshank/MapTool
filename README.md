MapTool VTT Resources 

This repository holds assets (maps, tokens, art and macros) for [RPTools MapTool](https://www.rptools.net/toolbox/maptool/). I'm currently running campaigns for Dungeons & Dragons 5e so the majority of files will be in that vein.

Many of the maps will require additional frameworks to function correctly. If you want full functionality, please make sure to install the following in order to load the map without errors:

****Required****
* [Takehara 5e Framework](https://github.com/rtakehara/5e-Framework) for character sheets, pin notes and some automation
* [MapTool_SmartDoors](https://github.com/bubblobill/MapTool_SmartDoors) for automated doors
* [Lib:Elevation](https://github.com/melek/lib_elevation) for tunnels and bridges

  
****Optional****
* [JMR DND5e Monster Tokens](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Al6_vh5ZO29wbSFo2JYoa37B86Y?e=B1OPKf) for additional monsters from a variety of D&D sources.
  * You can run the [Bulk Assignable Damage](/RPTools%20Macros/Bulk%20Assignable%20Damage.mtmacro) macro on these monster tokens to make the damage output into links that can then be applied to players (Takehara based). 
* [Wolph42's 'Drop-in' Bag of MT Tricks](https://forums.rptools.net/viewtopic.php?p=274501#p274501) for triggered elevation changes and for general quality of life
